Designing beyond the happy path

## Session URL

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Mockups reflect an idealised version of the product: the perfect text size and faultless content, all taken during a perfect user journey. However, they often fall apart once confronted with real content, technical limitations, and the vast diversity of user needs. We call those scenarios ‚Äúedge cases‚Äù. However, these aren't exceptions but an essential part of the user experience. This talk aims to redefine our approach to design by incorporating edge cases into the design process from the start. In doing so, we can build more robust, inclusive, and scalable products.

Think like a leader: 10 things UXers should stop (and start) doing to reclaim their power

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Every week, working with UXers and product designers at all levels ‚Äî in addition to those serving on teams of the clients he consults with ‚Äî Joe Natoli hears the same refrains over and over:



I‚Äôm stuck.&nbsp;



I‚Äôm lost.&nbsp;



I can‚Äôt.&nbsp;



I‚Äôm not allowed.&nbsp;



They won‚Äôt let me.&nbsp;



They don‚Äôt respect me.



They don‚Äôt listen.&nbsp;



They don‚Äôt care.



After 30+ years in this industry, Joe knows how true all of it is. He knows just how often UXers and Product Designers are marginalised, ignored and left out of critical decisions, even in organisations who publicly trumpet themselves as design- or UX-centric.&nbsp;



And Joe know how much all that hurts, how&nbsp;personally&nbsp;we take it.



And after all this time, he also knows that sometimes, there truly is nothing you can do about that. Sometimes your proposals for UX improvement ‚Äî additional user research, more design iteration cycles, or user testing ‚Äî are shot down by folks on the business side of the house whom&nbsp;you‚Äôve never met.



Here‚Äôs the thing: almost all of this stems from a lack of&nbsp;leadership; a lack of&nbsp;influence. And what you may not realise is that you actually have more power and influence than you think. And even if you don‚Äôt have influence, you are absolutely capable of&nbsp;gaining it&nbsp;‚Äî no matter what your job title is.



In this talk, Joe‚Äôs going to show you why all that is true. He‚Äôll also give you concrete ways you can overcome&nbsp;these obstacles, change your thinking and recognise the power you don‚Äôt realise you hold ‚Äî&nbsp;and begin&nbsp;using&nbsp;it.

What do the most successful websites have in common? They‚Äôre all fast. Faster sites have happier users. Those happy users visit your site more often and spend more money. But how do you know how fast you need to be? Industry stats and case studies tell only part of the story. You need to analyse your own user data to know when your site is fast enough to benefit your business ‚Äì and when page slowdowns are hurting it.



In this talk, Tammy shares in-depth insights from her research into the business value of site speed. She‚Äôll also demonstrate how to (and why) gather real user data, know how fast YOU need to be, create a better user experience, and improve the business metrics that matter to you ‚Äì from bounce rate to conversions.

As the web grows more powerful, so do user expectations. What feels fast today will be slow tomorrow, and meeting current performance standards will soon be the bare minimum. The real winners will be the apps that push beyond "fast enough" and strive for near-instantaneous performance.



Fortunately, a wave of new web standards is emerging, allowing us to inch closer and closer to making instantaneous performance a reality. In this talk, Tim will explore some of the exciting new tools available right now, and how you can start using them to stay one step ahead of your users and provide performance that feels instantaneous.

## Talk Description

Surveys are quite a popular yet very dangerous research tool. Though surveys have been used successfully in scientific studies for a very long time, they can still be rather risky when it comes to fast pace learning about our users. It‚Äôs easy to think that surveys are really easy to do, but in fact, if done wrong, they can falsely prove all your hypotheses while providing the illusion of doing research. In this talk, Zsuzsa will walk you through the main risks of surveys and explain in detail what can go wrong.

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Do you love standards but hatehatehate the developer experience (DX) of web components? Darko does too.



As a reformed sceptic of Web Components due to his DX concerns, Darko encountered an interesting challenge at SuperTokens: creating a UI library that supports all the frameworks and remains future-proof. After some research, he discovered that SolidJS compiles to Web Components, offering a familiar, React-like developer experience ‚Äî exactly what he needed to become a believer. After a couple of rounds of experimentation, he fell in love with web components.



This talk will share insights from his journey towards adopting Web Components for SuperToken‚Äôs next-gen authentication UI library and why web components are a great idea that's here to stay.

Premium Workshop: Accessibility for designers &#8211; from mockups to documentation

## Session URL

https://webexpo.net/prague2025/sessions/premium-workshop-accessibility-for-designers-from-mockups-to-documentation/

## Session Type

Premium Workshop

## Talk Description

Accessibility is often put on the plate of developers. But, a lot of accessibility issues can be caught and avoided in the mockups and design phase, by following best practices such as WCAG guidelines. If you‚Äôve never heard of it, you are in the right place!&nbsp;



In this workshop, we‚Äôll explore how to identify and address design issues early on, ensuring accessibility from the start. Things like: are we achieving the right contrast ratio, and are colours being used effectively? 












https://youtube.com/shorts/ahnhn3oxH7U?feature=share








But colours are just the tip of the iceberg!&nbsp; What about typography, is this text easy to read? Forms are also a crucial aspect of accessibility: I‚Äôll teach you how to make them more inclusive, from error prevention to recovery and beyond. We‚Äôll focus (haha pun intended) on essential elements like keyboard navigation, gesture controls, and drag-and-drop functionality‚Äîkey factors in designing and documenting complex components for users with diverse disabilities. We‚Äôll check screen reader usage and how to build and document a strong information architecture using headings, titles, and identifying landmarks. We‚Äôll cover alternatives to images, what designers can do about that, and multimedia, audio, video content, to charts and graphs.&nbsp;



The goal of this 1 day workshop is to equip you with the theory, but also the tools to help you audit, design, and document accessible mockups for your products and services. And to communicate it better with your development teams.



This is a hands-on workshop, we will work in Figma, in small groups, with different plugins, tools, and checklists. At the end of the workshop, you will get access to my slides, but also to checklists, cheat sheets and design tools to apply to your own designs.



What will attendees learn?




How to prevent fundamental accessibility issues in 4 areas: Visual design, interactions, navigation, and content availability.



How to design mockups of components and pages that take accessibility guidelines into account.



Understand what (future) accessibility issues designers can already preemptively fix in mockups.



Develop new skills for reviewing designs, identifying accessibility problems in existing design mockups, and resolving them.



Understand how to foster better team communication about accessibility by using design documentation.




Who is the workshop for?




Designers who want to learn more about accessibility and how to improve it.



Designers who need to communicate accessibility best practices to their development teams.



Coders who work with designers and want better communication around the topic of accessibility requirements.



Project people (POs, PMs) who want to push accessibility on a project and need to have designers and developers collaborate on accessibility and interactions and need tools.




What are the attendee requirements?




You don‚Äôt need any specific accessibility knowledge to attend, but you will need to be familiar with using a design tool for the workshop. We will use Figma for the exercises.



You‚Äôll also need a computer (Mac or Windows) with the following app installed: tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker.

Life isn‚Äôt all rainbows, unicorns or idealistic LinkedIn success stories. Sometimes things go south. Come to the Discomfort Zone to discuss taboo topics with Riki Fridrich and Ren√© Napravil.



So let‚Äôs zoom in on one of those uncomfortable moments that might hit close to home:



When you ask for a raise, do you know what you're worth, or are you just hoping for the best? How can you even get a raise when there's so much pressure to replace us with Indian workers or AI? Czech developers are no longer considered cheap labour, so what's next for us? Ren√© Napravil will tell you how to find your price and maybe even raise it.

Discussion: Accessibility in practice &#8211; why customer experience trumps legal requirements

## Session URL

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

When it comes to accessibility, legal compliance is only the beginning. What truly makes a difference is how people experience your website or app, especially those who rely on it the most.



In this panel, we‚Äôll move beyond checklists and standards to explore real-world accessibility from the perspectives of those who work with it ‚Äî and live with it ‚Äî every day.



You‚Äôll hear from:




Daniel, a blind front-end developer and accessibility specialist who brings both professional insight and personal experience. He knows what works and what doesn‚Äôt when it comes to accessible design.



Michaela, a design researcher and strategist with extensive experience bridging the gap between designers, developers, institutions, and end users. She'll share what helps (or hinders) inclusive design from taking root in teams and projects.



Luk√°≈°, who was born blind and relies on screen readers 24/7. He combines deep technical knowledge with the lived experience of a user and teaches developers how to build digital products that are accessible by default.




Join us for a grounded and practical conversation about what accessibility really means and how prioritising user experience leads to better, more inclusive results for everyone.

Software architecture often hides behind buzzwords and abstract concepts that feel disconnected from our daily work. Patterns like clean architecture, domains, or ports and adapters look great in examples, but we often get stuck once we start implementing them.



In this talk, Tom√°≈° will cut through the noise and show you practical real-world examples and patterns that will help you deliver better code. Using examples from his day-to-day job, as well as from his side projects, he‚Äôll show you how to implement some of these architectural patterns in practice and build more robust and maintainable applications.

What nobody else is telling you in the web industry

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

We often focus on the latest techniques and tooling, trying to optimise our workflows and processes. However, in the end, every single person has their own goals and ambitions, and too often our individual goals are left far behind the company goals and the product development roadmap.



In this session, Vitaly will be exploring some things that he wished he‚Äôd known when he was just in his 20s. How to find out about the company‚Äôs culture before getting there? How to negotiate your salary? How to get promotions? How to argue with senior management? What are the warning signs to keep in mind? We‚Äôll look into all of it ‚Äî in a frank, open-minded and friendly conversation that will help you manage some difficult situations in your company, and moving forward to your ambitions and your goals.

How to speak engineer (without being one)

## Session URL

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

You don‚Äôt need to write code to lead in tech, but you do need to speak the language. In today‚Äôs hybrid, engineering-driven environments, the ability to collaborate across disciplines is more valuable than ever. In this keynote, ≈†√°rka Kohoutov√° shares how non-technical leaders can build trust, drive alignment, and deliver real impact - without writing a single line of code. Drawing from 18 years at Microsoft and a career spent bridging business and tech, she‚Äôll unpack how to translate strategy into systems, feedback into features, and ‚ÄúCan you explain that in plain English?‚Äù into a superpower. Expect practical frameworks, real-world stories, and a few laughs along the way.
