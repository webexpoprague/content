Conference Talk

## Talk Description

In many products, search is critical, yet too often it’s forgotten or overlooked. Many users rely heavily on search, and investing in good search experiences is almost always a very smart investment. So, how do people search and what do they expect from a first-class search experience in 2025? And what can you do to design better experiences for them? In this talk, Vitaly will explore how to design better autocomplete, deal with complex filters, improve sorting, build better search result pages — and much, much more. Roll up your sleeves: expect plenty of real-life examples, dos and don’ts, and a healthy dose of “Aha!”-moments.

Designing beyond the happy path

## Session URL

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Mockups reflect an idealised version of the product: the perfect text size and faultless content, all taken during a perfect user journey. However, they often fall apart once confronted with real content, technical limitations, and the vast diversity of user needs. We call those scenarios “edge cases”. However, these aren't exceptions but an essential part of the user experience. This talk aims to redefine our approach to design by incorporating edge cases into the design process from the start. In doing so, we can build more robust, inclusive, and scalable products.

Think like a leader: 10 things UXers should stop (and start) doing to reclaim their power

## Session URL

https://webexpo.net/prague2025/sessions/joe-natoli-ux-design-2025/

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Every week of my life, in one-on-one consults with UXers and product designers at all levels — in addition to those serving on teams of the clients I work with as a consultant — I hear the same refrains over and over:



I’m stuck.&nbsp;



I’m lost.&nbsp;



I can’t.&nbsp;



I’m not allowed.&nbsp;



They won’t let me.&nbsp;



They don’t respect me.



They don’t listen.&nbsp;



They don’t care.



It hurts my heart to hear this, because I know — after 30+ years in this industry — just how true all of it is. I know just how much UXers and Product Designers are disrespected and marginalized, even in organizations who publicly trumpet themselves as design- or UX-centric. And I know how much all that hurts, how&nbsp;personally&nbsp;we take it.



And also, after all this time, I know that sometimes, there truly is nothing you can do about that. So I’m also going to talk about those scenarios and how to deal with them at the end of our time together.



In many cases I come across, however,&nbsp;there IS something you can do, provided you take a&nbsp;very&nbsp;different approach to overcoming these obstacles and change your thinking, from both a personal and professional standpoint.



Provided you find the courage to work through your fear and take the first step.



Provided you can recognize the power you don’t realize you hold — and begin using it.



This talk is a practical guide to help UX researchers, designers, and product professionals not just survive but thrive by thinking like a leader — even when leadership isn’t in your job title. You’ll walk away with actionable strategies to start breaking through barriers and creating the impact you were hired to deliver.

Robocop (1987) introduced us to a vision of the future where humanity and technology combined to serve, protect, and uphold justice. Murphy embodied what we strive for in AI today: precision, ethics, and a mission to protect.



But ED-209? A cautionary tale of what happens when we prioritise power over control and ambition over accountability.



We stand at a crossroads. AI can be our Murphy: protective, ethical, and safe. Or it can become ED-209: unchecked and dangerous. The choice is ours, and this talk offers a roadmap to ensure we march towards the former.

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

What do the most successful websites have in common? They’re all fast. Faster sites have happier users. Those happy users visit your site more often and spend more money. But how do you know how fast you need to be? Industry stats and case studies tell only part of the story. You need to analyse your own user data to know when your site is fast enough to benefit your business – and when page slowdowns are hurting it.



In this talk, Tammy shares in-depth insights from her research into the business value of site speed. She’ll also demonstrate how to (and why) gather real user data, know how fast YOU need to be, create a better user experience, and improve the business metrics that matter to you – from bounce rate to conversions.

## Talk Description

Get ready to take a dive with Tereza into the facilitation and communication skills designers, leaders, and facilitators use every day. Whether you’re in the middle of a design sprint, running a workshop, leading a 1:1, or navigating an agile ceremony, process-oriented facilitation can help you be more supportive and effective — even when the road gets rough. Tereza will look at how these skills help you navigate uncertainty, conflict, and change (Think: Covid, layoffs, team burnout, and more.).



With practical examples and straightforward techniques, Tereza will show you how to bring a bit of "slow leadership" into every interaction — not by pushing for quick wins but by creating a space where your team can genuinely thrive. This talk is for those in design, UX, product management, or anyone who wants to make a real impact. Not by "failing fast" or “breaking things,” but by building spaces where teams feel valued and work is made to last.

Future-proof your UI: Building with Web Components

## Session Type

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Do you love standards but hatehatehate the developer experience (DX) of web components? Darko does too.



As a reformed sceptic of Web Components due to his DX concerns, Darko encountered an interesting challenge at SuperTokens: creating a UI library that supports all the frameworks and remains future-proof. After some research, he discovered that SolidJS compiles to Web Components, offering a familiar, React-like developer experience — exactly what he needed to become a believer. After a couple of rounds of experimentation, he fell in love with web components.



This talk will share insights from his journey towards adopting Web Components for SuperToken’s next-gen authentication UI library and why web components are a great idea that's here to stay.

Did you know that more than 40% of the CMS market carries risks? Some of the biggest threats relate to security. Last year, there were around 6,000 vulnerability reports related to themes, plugins, and core functionality. That's a huge number and a big problem for many users. WordPress’s reputation when it comes to security is one of the most common reasons why users decide to pick another CMS instead.



Patchstack is the official security point of contact for more than 300 WordPress plugins, offering the fastest protection for WordPress security vulnerabilities. In this talk, Maciek will explain what WordPress security looks like, whether it’s actually that bad, what Patchstack is doing to make it better, and the biggest challenges his team is facing.

When content design is brought in late, you run the risk of it becoming a quick fix rather than an integral part of the user experience. Just-in-time content design applies a dual approach: integrating content at the right moments within team workflows and delivering it strategically in the UI to meet user needs. Through real-world examples, Erin will illustrate timing principles that guide you on when to bring in content designers to foster cross-functional collaboration and shape product flows, and on crafting UI content that resonates — precisely when users need it.

Conference Talk

## Talk Description

Retrofitting accessibility can take time, money, and effort. Who wouldn't be tempted by the perspective of letting someone else handle it? All you have to do is pay and then insert one line of code into your project. Job done. The only problem is it doesn't work.



In this talk for coders, designers, and managers, Lukáš will explain the basics of what accessibility overlays are, how they (don't) work, and most importantly, why you should avoid them like the plague.

Premium Workshop: Accessibility for designers &#8211; from mockups to documentation

## Session URL

https://webexpo.net/prague2025/sessions/premium-workshop-accessibility-for-designers-from-mockups-to-documentation/

## Session Type

Premium Workshop

## Talk Description

Accessibility is often put on the plate of developers. But, a lot of accessibility issues can be caught and avoided in the mockups and design phase, by following best practices such as WCAG guidelines. If you’ve never heard of it, you are in the right place! 



In this workshop, we’ll explore how to identify and address design issues early on, ensuring accessibility from the start. Things like: are we achieving the right contrast ratio, and are colours being used effectively? But colours are just the tip of the iceberg!&nbsp; What about typography, is this text easy to read? Forms are also a crucial aspect of accessibility: I’ll teach you how to make them more inclusive, from error prevention to recovery and beyond. We’ll focus (haha pun intended) on essential elements like keyboard navigation, gesture controls, and drag-and-drop functionality—key factors in designing and documenting complex components for users with diverse disabilities. We’ll check screen reader usage and how to build and document a strong information architecture using headings, titles, and identifying landmarks. We’ll cover alternatives to images, what designers can do about that, and multimedia, audio, video content, to charts and graphs.&nbsp;



The goal of this 1 day workshop is to equip you with the theory, but also the tools to help you audit, design, and document accessible mockups for your products and services. And to communicate it better with your development teams.



This is a hands-on workshop, we will work in Figma, in small groups, with different plugins, tools, and checklists. At the end of the workshop, you will get access to my slides, but also to checklists, cheat sheets and design tools to apply to your own designs.







What will attendees learn?




How to prevent fundamental accessibility issues in 4 areas: Visual design, interactions, navigation, and content availability.



How to design mockups of components and pages that take accessibility guidelines into account.



Understand what (future) accessibility issues designers can already preemptively fix in mockups.



Develop new skills for reviewing designs, identifying accessibility problems in existing design mockups, and resolving them.



Understand how to foster better team communication about accessibility by using design documentation.




Who is the workshop for?




Designers who want to learn more about accessibility and how to improve it.



Designers who need to communicate accessibility best practices to their development teams.



Coders who work with designers and want better communication around the topic of accessibility requirements.



Project people (POs, PMs) who want to push accessibility on a project and need to have designers and developers collaborate on accessibility and interactions and need tools.




What are the attendee requirements?




You don’t need any specific accessibility knowledge to attend, but you will need to be familiar with using a design tool for the workshop. We will use Figma for the exercises.



You’ll also need a computer (Mac or Windows) with the following app installed: tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker.
