PRAGUE IS OUR HOME

























Located in Lucerna Palace



Lucerna Palace is the home of WebExpo, located in the heart of Prague. On foot, you’re only 5 minutes from the iconic National Museum and 10 minutes from the famous Old Town Square. Prague has plenty to see — when you're not filling your brain at WebExpo, of course!



Want to learn more?



WebExpo alumni Janek Rubeš has plenty of ideas on the best things to see and do on his YouTube channel HONEST GUIDE.







WEBEXPO 4 KIDS





The first tech conference for all ages!



WebExpo welcomes attendees of all ages! We’ll be running kids' workshops organised by Jakub Balada and Tomáš Kapler throughout the day near the Lucerna Café. They’ll explore various AI tools, learn about 3D printing, program in Scratch and enjoy LEGO BOOST &amp; SPIKE. Younger children (2+ years) can have fun with our au pairs in the Kids’ Corner. For parents with babies and toddlers, the Parents’ Coffee Lounge is the perfect hang-out to rest and have a chat. Plus, you can bring the whole family — every WebExpo ticket comes with a second adult entrance to the children’s area and partners’ booths for free.



What WebExpo parents say



"Our kids absolutely loved the 3D printing and Lego robotics workshops - it was really nice letting them have a little look inside the nerdy life we live." - Petr Vostrý
